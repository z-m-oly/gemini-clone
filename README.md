# Gemini UI Clone (Learning Project)

This project is a personal learning endeavor to replicate the user interface of Google's Gemini using React, Vanilla JavaScript, and CSS. It's built with Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Description

This repository contains the source code for a UI clone of Gemini. The primary goal of this project is to improve my front-end development skills, particularly in:

* **React:** Building interactive components and managing application state.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Implementing core functionalities and logic.
* **CSS:** Styling the application to closely resemble the Gemini UI.
* **Vite:** Utilizing a modern build tool for rapid development.

Please note that this is a learning project and does not include any of the backend functionality or AI capabilities of the actual Gemini application. It focuses solely on replicating the visual and interactive aspects of the UI.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** For building the user interface.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For application logic.
* **CSS:** For styling.
* **Vite:** As a fast build tool.
